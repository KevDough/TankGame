## Project Description
The objective of our project is to create a basic tank game, heavily influenced by the popular game Wii Tanks! In the game, the player takes control of a blue tank within a small rectangular arena inhabited by enemy tanks. The objective of the game is to complete 'missions' which involve the player defeating all enemy tanks in the arena without themselves being damaged, thus advancing to the next mission.
